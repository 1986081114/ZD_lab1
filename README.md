#                              ZD_lab1


#####      Group Members: Zhao Ji ,   Duan Shoujian

#####       laboratory work number:  1

#####      variant description: Unrolled linked list (you can use built-in list inside node).



##### synopsis:

​     The laboratory course is aimed at obtaining practical skills in the computing process organization, mostly by developing tools for its description and evaluation.



#####  summary for each group member:  

​    Zhao Ji Write "LinkList.py", he is about the realization of variable library, while using the typing module
​     Duan Shoujian Write "immutable_linklist.py" He is about the implementation of immutable libraries,



##### explanation of taken design decisions and analysis:

​     We use different implementation methods to create singly-linked lists and realize the basic functions of singly-linked lists, and test the running time of variable versus immutable



##### work demonstration (how to use developed software, how to test it), should be repeatable by an instructor by given command-line examples:

​    The teacher can download the file from git and run it through pycharm to get the experimental results

 

##### conclusion:

​    It can be seen from the running time that the unvariable module time is better than the variable module
